Back in 1945, Vannevar Bush, a Director of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development, proposed a device, which he called memex:

\begin{quote}
Consider a future device \ldots{} in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory. \ldots{} The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him. And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outraged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. \ldots{} --- \href{https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/}{The Atlantic, July 1945}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Memex and Zettelkasten}

The \emph{memex} machine is often thought of as a precursor of the Internet, where information is interconnected. Vannevar Bush, however, seems to have viewed more as a personal machine knowledge organization system, to use a modern term. A system that would facilitate coordination of relevant pieces of information into organized sequences that he himself called ``trails''.

The idea of a personal knowledge device is still of great relevance and of great importance to scholars and scientists whose job is to construct such trails on a daily basis. Needless to say that historians will particulary benefit from having such a machine at their disposal (as Bush's example about the Turkish bow and the English longbow indicates, see \citep{BushWe1945}).

While it is not necessary to adhere slavishly to Bush's vision, we can definitely use his vision as a springboad to develop something similar; something that will allow us to navigate the massive volumes of information, which grew significantly since the 1940s.

In the following two sections you will find some relevant materials on memex and the history of this idea. Here, however, I want to take some time to think about how the design of our own memex should look like. What do we want from it? What can we reasonably achieve?

Before I procede to that, I would like to dwell on another relevant and, in my opinion, closely connected idea --- that of \emph{Zettelkasten}. On its own, there is nothing particularly interestin and exciting about it, as the word refers to a rather unexciting piece of furniture: a ``slip-box'', or a ``card-box''. However, this term became closely associated with Niklas Luhmann, a German professor of sociology (U Bielefeld), who is considered one of the most prolific scholars of the 20th century. Like others, Luhmann himself attributed his productivity to his working method and the knowledge organization system which he implemented and systematically used throughout his career \citep[See,][]{LuhmannKommunikation1982, LuhmannArchimedes1987}.

\emph{NB:} Detailed bibliography can be found at the end of the section and in the References section (see, TOC).

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{On Memex}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citep{BushWe1945} is the first article---``As We May Think''---that Vannevar Bush published on memex in \emph{The Atlantic}. This \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c539cK58ees}{animation} imagines the way memex would have functioned (produced by the organizers of the Brown/MIT symposium).
\item
  \citep{NyceMemex1991} is the book that came out of the symposium held at the The Brown/MIT Vannevar Bush Symposium in 1995, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Bush's groundbreaking article ``As We May Think''. The book includes several Bush's articles on memex that show the evolution of his thinking about this device. This book is difficult to find; someone made \href{https://monoskop.org/File:Nyce_James_Kahn_Paul_eds_From_Memex_to_Hypertext_Vannevar_Bush_and_the_Minds_Machine.epub}{an EPUB version of it} (also shared via \emph{Slack}). Recordings of the symposium are available on YouTube:; other videos of this symposium can also be found at the Video Archive of \emph{The MIT/Brown Vannevar Bush Symposium} \url{https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/258/000/}. I highly recommend you watch \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwwvMUzasU0\&t=1853s}{\emph{Paul Kahn: A Visual Tour of Vannevar Bush's Work}}; other presentations are very interesting as well.
\item
  \citep{ParkMemex2014} is an recent experiment (MA Thesis in Design), trying to create a version of memex.

\section{Bibliography Managers}\label{bibliography-managers}}

Bibliography managers make your life easier when it comes to collectin, organizing and maintaining bibliographical references and your library of electronic publications (most commonly as PDFs). Additionally, they are an indispensable writing tool as they take care of formatting (and reformatting) references and bibliographies in any writing project that you might undertake. There are plenty of different programs out there with their advantages and disadvantages (for example, Mendeley, RefWorks, Citavi, Endnote, Papers, Zotero, and quite a few more). We will use Zotero---it is being developed by scholars for scholars; it is free and open source; it does pretty much everything you might possibly need from a program of this kind.

\hypertarget{zotero}{%
\section{Zotero}\label{zotero}}

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\subsection{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zotero can be installed from here: \url{https://www.zotero.org/download/}; the page will offer you a version suitable for your operating system, but you should also see the links to versions for specific systems (Mac OS, Windows, Linux).
\item
  During installation Zotero should automatically integrate into your browser (like Chrome or Firefox) and into your word processor (MS Word, LibreOffice, GoogleDocs are supported). It is possible that you may have to do that manually.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Zotero Connector for Chrome can be installed from the same page (\url{https://www.zotero.org/download/})
  \item
    detailed explanations on how to use word processor plugins can be found \href{https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration}{here}; you can use Zotero with \href{https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage}{MS Word}, \href{https://www.zotero.org/support/libreoffice_writer_plugin_usage}{LibreOffice} and \href{https://www.zotero.org/support/google_docs}{Google Docs}; in case you cannot get your plugin activated, check the \href{https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_troubleshooting}{Troubleshooting Section}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{main-functionality}{%
\subsection{Main Functionality}\label{main-functionality}}

You need to be able to do the following tasks with your Zotero in order to take full advantage of its functionality.

(If you prefer video tutorials, you can check a series of \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4asXgsr6ek5H5mM9GlA1d-YCb9KvP3Ja}{Zotero Tutorials prepared by McGill Library}; there are also plenty other tutorials on YouTube :)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Adding bibliographical records (and PDFs)}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Using Zotero Connector}: the easiest way to add a reference is from a browser with Zotero connector. This can be done practically from any library or journal database (e.g., Uni Wien Library, Worldcat.org, JSTOR); simply click the connector button while you are on a page with a publication that you want to add to your Zotero database. PDF may be automatically downloaded, if available; keep in mind that in places like JSTOR you need to agree to terms before this function will work; what you need to do is to download one PDF manually from a JSTOR page, where you will be asked to agree to terms of their services;
\item
  \emph{Drag-and-dropping PDFs into Zotero}; this however works only when Zotero can parse relevant bibliographical information from a PDF; This might be a good way to start if you already have lots of PDFs that you want to add to Zotero.
\item
  \emph{Using Unique Identifiers}: you can use ISBN or DOI numbers.
\item
  \emph{Using Import}: you can import bibliographical data from another application or from bibliographical files (formats, like RIS, which you can download from most libraries as well).
\item
  \emph{Manually}: you can manually add and fill in a record as well.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Write-and-cite}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Detailed Instructions}: \href{https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage}{MS Word}, \href{https://www.zotero.org/support/libreoffice_writer_plugin_usage}{LibreOffice} and \href{https://www.zotero.org/support/google_docs}{Google Docs}; you can also check the video tutorial.
\item
  \emph{Add a citation}
\item
  \emph{Customize a citation} (by adding prefixes, suffixes, page range for a specific reference, etc.).
\item
  \emph{Change citation style}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For example, change from \emph{Chicago Manual of Style} to \emph{Universität Wien - Institut für Geschichte} (Yes, there is this specific citation style for Zotero: \url{https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=id\%3Auniversitat-wien-institut-fur-geschichte}); in order to do that you need to download the IfG style and install it into Zotero.
  \item
    You can find lots of different citation styles here: \url{https://www.zotero.org/styles}; to add a new style to Zotero:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      download the style you want.
    \item
      Open Zotero. Go to Preferences (under Zotero, Edit, or Tools --- depending on your system).
    \item
      Click the ``Cite'' button.
    \item
      Click the ``Styles'' tab.
    \item
      Click the \texttt{+} button at the bottom right.
    \item
      Select the style file you saved in the first step.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Generate and update bibliography} in your paper.
\item
  \textbf{NB:} If you use Zotero plugin for adding your citations, they remain connected to Zotero and can be automatically reformatted; you can also drag-and-drop any bibliographical record into any text editor---the reference will be formatted according to the currently selelected style, but it will not be connected to Zotero and cannot be reformatted automatically later.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{General Maintenance and Organization}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zotero can {[}automatically{]} rename PDFs using metadata, although the default function is not very robust (see, \emph{Zotfile} plugin below).
\item
  You can create ``collections'' and drag-and-drop publications relevant to a specific topic or project you are working on.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{additional-functionality-plug-ins}{%
\subsection{Additional Functionality: Plug-Ins}\label{additional-functionality-plug-ins}}

There is a variety of third-party plugins that you can add to Zotero for additional functionality. The list of plugins can be found at \url{https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins}. To install a plugin, you need to download its \texttt{.xpi} file to your computer. Then, in Zotero, click ``Tools → Add-Ons'', then drag the \texttt{.xpi} for the plugin onto the Add-Ons window that opens. Two plugins will be of particular interest to us: \texttt{Zotfile} and \texttt{BetterBibTeX}.

\hypertarget{zotfile}{%
\subsection{Zotfile}\label{zotfile}}

Zotfile (\url{http://zotfile.com/}) is a Zotero plugin to manage your attachments: automatically rename, move, and attach PDFs (or other files) to Zotero items, sync PDFs from your Zotero library to your (mobile) PDF reader (e.g.~an iPad, Android tablet, etc.) and extract annotations from PDF files.

This plugin is particularly helpful for organizing PDFs on your hard drive. By default, Zotero saves PDFs in a computationally safe, but humanely incomprehensible manner: each PDF, even if it is renamed from bibliographical metadata and is human readable, it is still placed into a folder whose name is a random sequence of characters. Zotfile allows you to organize PDFs in a more human-friendly manner. The first screenshot below shows Zotero default mode, while the second one shows Zotfile mode: essentially, Zotfile creates a folder for each author and PDFs of all publications by that author get placed in that folder. You can sync this folder with Dropbox or other cloud service and access it from your tablet or phone.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{better-bibtex-for-zotero}{%
\subsection{Better BibTeX for Zotero}\label{better-bibtex-for-zotero}}

For a moment this will not be an immediately useful plug-in, but it is the most important one for our Memex project. This plugin exports bibliographical data into a \texttt{bibTeX} format, which is very easy to process with python scripts (it also generates \emph{citation keys} which can be used for citation in markdown, which we will cover later). The two screenshots below show how the same record looks in Zotero preview and in the \texttt{bibTeX} format.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{homework}{%
\section{Homework}\label{homework}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  collect 30-50 bibliographic records into your Zotero (ideally with PDFs); the number may seem like a lot, but you will see that you can do that it will take only about 30 mins on JSTOR; those of you who are already using Zotero must already have more than 50 records in your databases.
\item
  clearly, you should be collecting items that are relevant to your fields of study and your research; organize them into folders, if that is necessary;
\item
  create Bibliography and email it to me (this is one-click operation; try to figure on your own how to do this; asking on \emph{Slack} counts);
\item
  make sure that you are comfortable with the main functionality of Zotero; that you have the discussed plugins installed; to get comfortable with the main functionality, you should practice each listed procedure at least a couple of times.
\end{itemize}

\end{quote}

The memex machine is often thought of as a precursor of the Internet. Be it as it may, the idea of a personal knowledge device is still of great relevance and of great importance to scholars and scientists whose job is to construct such trails on a regular basis. Needless to say that \emph{historians} will benefit greatly from having such a machine at their disposal. The course will introduce you to basic, intermediate, and some advanced computational techniques, which will allow you to build and maintain your own digital memex machine.

No prior programming experience is expected (we will be learning Python). Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on exercises led by the instructor. Laptops are required for the course. We will accommodate whatever operating system you use (Windows, Mac, or Linux), but it must be a laptop rather than a tablet.

\hypertarget{course-evaluation}{%

Course evaluation will be a combination of in-class participation (30\%), weekly homework assignments (50\%), and the final project (20\%).

\hypertarget{class-participation}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Class Participation}

Attendance is required; regular participation is the key to completing the course; all students must come with their laptops; homework assignments must be submitted on time (some can be completed later as a part of the final project, but this must be discussed with the instructor whenever the issue arises); the final project must be submitted on time.

\hypertarget{homework}{%
\section*{Homework}\label{homework}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Homework}

Just as in research and real life, collaboration is a very good way to learn and is therefore encouraged. If you need help with any assignment, you are welcome to ask a fellow student. If you do work together on homework assignments, then when you submit it please include a brief note (just a sentence or two) to indicate who did what.

\textbf{NB:} On submitting homework, see below.

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\section*{Final Project}\label{final-project}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Final Project}

The final project is your own memex machine, which can help you with your studies and your research. Your final project must include all working scripts that will allow you in the future to continuously expand your memex machine by adding new readings into the mix. You are most welcome to work on this final project in groups, but everybody is required to produce their own working machine.

We will use several resources and the emphasis will be on you studying on your own: partially, this is because of time constraints, but more importantly, you will need to acquire a skill of learning on your own. No worries, I will provide necessary help whenever needed.
  \item
    This textbook will be our main resource. It is well written and will help you to wrap your heads around important computer science concepts; this reading is crucial and without it many interactive tutorials out there will not be particularly helpful. Each chapter has assignments and self-test multiple choice sections;
  \item
    Supplementary materials are available at \href{https://fbeedle.com/our-books/23-python-programming-an-introduction-to-computer-science-3rd-ed-9781590282755.html}{the publisher's website}, where you can download example code and end-of-chapter solutions; additionaly, you can find videos with complimentary instructions

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Homework assignments are to be submitted by the beginning of the next class;
\item
  For the first few classes you must email them to the instructor (as attachments)
\item
  Later, you will be publishing your homework assignments on your websites and sending an email to the instructor informing that you have completed your homework and providing a link to the blogpost with the homework report that you created.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the subject of your email, please, use the following format: \texttt{CourseID-LessonID-HW-Lastname-matriculationNumber}, for example, if I were to submit homework for the first lesson, my subject header would look like: \texttt{070112-L01-HW-Romanov-12435687}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  DH is a collaborative field, so you are most welcome to work on your homework assignments in groups, however:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You must still submit it. That is, if a groups of three works on one assignment, there must be three separate submissions emailed from each member's email.
