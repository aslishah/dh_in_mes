# Lesson 07

## Building Memex - Step 1

First and foremost, we need to build the structure for our memex. This involves the following steps:

1. loading our bibTeX data and parsing it properly into a dictionary (you can build on the solution to the previous lesson);
2. looping through the dictionary of our bibliographical data in order to save relevant information into the structure of our memex, which shoould be as shown on the screenshot below. Such folder structure is very easy to generate computationally knowing only the citation key of each publication, which will allow to manipulate our data with ease, no matter how massive it becomes.

### Pseudocode

- load bibliographical data into a dictionary
  - some data will need to be filtered, fixed, and probably reformatted slightly, etc. (build on the previously created function); use your Zotero data;
- loop through your dictionary and process each record:
  - generate relative path for your record
    - this path will consist of two parts:
      - the path to your memex folder (either relative or absolute); this one you can define in your yml settings file (something like `./MEMEX_SANDBOX/data/`).
      - the relative path to a publucation within your memex folder
        - the relative path must be generated from the citation key of each publication like this --- `./1stLetter/2firstLetters/citeKey/`
        - thus, if the key is `McCartyHumanities2014`, the path must be `./m/mc/McCartyHumanities2014/` (subFolder = `key.lower()[0]`;
 subSubFolder = `key.lower()[:2]`; subSubSubFolder = `key`; **Question:** Why would we need to `.lower()`?)
	- create the subfolder, using this path
	- save into this folder a bibTeX record for the publication with the name `key.bib` (i.e., `McCartyHumanities2014.bib`);
	- copy the PDF file into this folder and save it in a similar manner: `key.pdf` (i.e., `McCartyHumanities2014.pdf`).

### Code snippets

Some of the following code snippets should be helpful (although you may find different ways of getting to the same results, which is, of course, totally fine).

**Snippet 1: Load YML File into a Dictionary**

```python
import yaml

settingsFile = "z_config.yml"
settings = yaml.load(open(settingsFile))

```

**Snippet 2: Create Folder, if Does Not Exist**

```python
import os

if not os.path.exists(folder):
  os.makedirs(folder)
```

**Snippet 3: Copy File to a Distination**

```python
import shutil

if not os.path.isfile(dst):
  shutil.copyfile(src, dst)
```

where `scr` is the path to where the file was, and `dst` is the path to where you want your file. Keep in mind, that in `dst` you can use the name of the file that you want! 

**Snippet 4: Making Path Properly**

As you remember from our introduction to command line, Mac and Windows format paths differently, which will create issues if *manually* construct the path. The best way to avoid any issues is to construct paths with a proper library.

```python
import os

yourPath = os.path.join(folder, subfolder, subsubfolder, fileName)

## Homework Solution{#HWL07S}

### Pseudocode

- creating the overall structure for our MEMEX on HDD
	1) using out bibliographical data, we algorithmically generate paths for each publication
	2) we create those paths
	3) we copy relevant data into those paths:
		1) bibliographical record (bib);
		2) PDF files

Let’s break it down into smaller steps:

- first of all, it will actually be easier of take a look at this task from another perspective.
	- we should start from a single publication, or, better, a single bibliographical record.
	- after we figure out how to process a single publication, we will just need to figure out how to process all of them

- so, let's start with a single bib record:
	- (we have written a function before that creates a dictionary from every bib record (let's call it **loadBib()**); so let our function take such a single-record dictionary as its argument);
	- what will we need from our function (let's call it **processBibRecord()**)? it must do the following:
		- to generate a unique path for the publication
		- check if that path exists, if not: create it
		- save bib record into that folder
		- copy PDF to that folder
	- what do we need to consider:
		- we need a simple and transparent way to algorithmically generate all this data, which will ensure easy access, browsability, and overall transparency of our approach. In order to achieve it, we can use *a single* element from each record to generate all necessary paths and filenames. Namely, the *citation key*.

	- **path:** our path will be a concatenation of the path to memex (for example, `./MEMEX_SANDBOX/data/`) and a subpath unique to each publication, which we can generate from the citation key.
		- for example, if the citation key is `SavantMuslims2017`, the publication path should be `/s/sa/SavantMuslims2017/`
		- the concatenated path thus will be: `./MEMEX_SANDBOX/data/s/sa/SavantMuslims2017/`
		- **NB:** it may be a good idea to have a small function that takes paths to memex and the citation key as its arguments and returns the final path (let's call it **generatePublPath()**).
	- now, that we have **the path**, we can check whether it exists, and, if not, create it
	- now, we have our path and the actual folder on HDD, it is easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy to save a bibliographical record and a PDF into that folder.
		- for the same considerations of machine-readability, we should use use the citation key to name our files: for example, `SavantMuslims2017.bib` for our bibliographical record, and `SavantMuslims2017.pdf` for our PDF file.

- now, we have a function that does all that we need from a single record, we can write another function (let's call it **processAllRecords()**) that will
	- take the large bibliographical dictionary generated with **loadBib()** as its argument
	- loops through this dictionary, and processes each record with **processBibRecord()**.


### Note on Folder/File Organization

It is crucial that all our files have their places and there are only as many files as we need. Otherwise, things get unmanageable very quickly.

1. Create `memex_sandbox` repository on github
	1. add `.gitignore` with template for Python
	2. edit `.gitignore` on github.com, by adding the following two lines to the top

```
_data/
.DS_Store
```

2. Clone the repository to your machine
3. Let’s organize everything nicely here. Like this:

```sh
_bib/
_data/
_misc/
1_build_structure.md
1_build_structure.py
2_OCR_test.py
settings.yml
```

- `_bib/` : all bibliography-related files
	- Zotero bibliography
	- language codes dictionary
	- etc.
- `_data/` : folder where we will be generating all the data; this folder is added to `.gitignore` so that none of the data would be uploaded to github (reason: copyright)
- `_misc` : all other miscellaneous files go here; we can also move all the files we no longer need into this folder (keeping the main folder clean).
- `settings.yml` should look something like:

```yml
path_to_memex: ./_data/
bib_all: ./_bib/zotero_bibliography.bib
bibtex_keys: ./_bib/bibtex_keys.yml
```
