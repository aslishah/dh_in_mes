# Lesson 10: Graphing Chronological Distribution of Tagged Entities

## Abstractions of Newspaper Articles

In the previous lesson we created *abstractions* of our newspaper articles. Namely, we reduced the text in natural languages to mentions of places, persons, and organizations. Together, they give us an idea of the main actors (persons and organizations), i.e. who is involved in some developments described in each article, and main locations (placenames) of where these developments took place.

DATE: 1864-04-28
TYPE: article
HEADER: Yankee rule in Plymouth.
TEXT: Yankee rule in Plymouth.<br> The following orders are copies of hand-bills
  posted in the town of Plymouth.<br> It will be seen that Brig. Gen. Wessels is
  a model after Lincoln 's own heart, and undertook to "run the churches" and
  the schools besides.<br> As we find the names of the General and the Provost
  Marshal, and the A. A., G.'s on the register of the Libby Hotel, in this city,
  it is more than likely that the children "between eight and fourteen" in
  Plymouth are having a cheerful vacation, and that Col. Moffitt will refrain
  for the present from the disagreeable duty of reporting the derelict heads of
  families who don't enforce their attendance.<br> This is the school order<br>
  Notice.<br> The inhabitants of Plymouth are hereby notified that a Free school,
  for white children, will be spend under competent teachers,<br> On Monday, 18th
  inst,<br> in the Episcopal Church.<br> The attention of parents and guardians
  is called in this important subject; and it is expected that all children
  between eight and fourteen years of age will attend the school.<br> Those over
  fourteen may attend if they wish.<br> Lieut. Col. Moffitt, Provost Marshal,
  will institute careful inquiries, and report such families as neglect to avail
  themselves of the advantages thus offered. By command of Brig. Gen. H. W.
  Wessels, Andrew Stewart, Assistant Adjutant General. Plymouth, N. C., April
  14th, 1864.<br> And this is the order for running the churches<br> Notice<br>
  Until further orders church call will be sounded at the Provost Guard on
  Sundays, at fifteen minutes before 11 A. M., and at 2.15 P. M. the call to be
  repeated promptly by the drums of the several regiments and detachments.<br>
  The annoyance caused by entering and leaving the churches during the
  performance of Divine service, and by the practice of spitting on the floor
  is excessive, and it is hoped that these evils will be corrected without the
  necessity of individual reproof. By order of Brig. Gen. H. W. Wessels, D. F.
  Beegle, Lieut, A. D. C. & A. A. A. G. Plymouth, N. C, April 11th, 1864.

Thus, the article above (`1864-04-28_article_002`) can be abstracted to the following data (here, based exclusively on entities already tagged in the initial XML documents):

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
library(knitr)
data<-read.table(file = './files/entities.csv', sep = '\t', header = TRUE)
kable(data)
```

Such abstractions can never fully replace the *close reading* of text, but they open up possibilities of *distant reading* of the entire corpus of our newspaper. For example, we can measure the frequencies of mentions of specific entities over time in order to assess their prominence and importance across the entire period as well as to identify specific moments in time, when they (people, places, organizations/institutions) soared to some level of importance. Additionally, we can also assess how traditional reading can be reinforces or informed by distant reading. Let's now take a look at a couple of simple examples. (After which we will take a look at the code and you will get an assignment to modify it.)

## Homework{#HWL10}

- Finish the assigned task;
- Annotate your script (i.e., add comment to every line of code describing what is happenning there);

**Submitting homework:**

* Homework assignment must be submitted by the beginning of the next class;
* Now, that you know how to use GitHub, you will be submitting your homework pushing it to github:
  * Create a relevant subfolder in your repository and place your HW files there; push them to your GitHub account;
	* Email me the link to your repository with a short message (Something like: *I have completed homework for Lesson 3, which is uploaded to my repository ... in subfolder `L03`*)
