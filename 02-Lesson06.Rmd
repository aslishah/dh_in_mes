# Lesson 06: Webscraping

## Getting to Know `WGET`

Here we will discuss webscraping --- the main process of efficiently collecting large volumes of information from the Internet.

## Software:

* `wget` (<https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>), a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive command line tool, so it may easily be called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

* **NB**: on installing `wget`:
	* On Windows (the easiest): download from <https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/> > choose the latest 64-bit ZIP file (`EXE` will most likely be blocked by your browser as a potentially dangerous file).
		* Unzip the file and copy `wget.exe` to the folder where you are planning to scrape data; *NB:* the easiest approach on Windows is to move/copy this file into relevant folders. 
	* On Mac (and, possibly, Linux): `brew install wget`

## Class:

* practical examples of working with `wget`
* single link download
* batch download
	* web-page analysis
	* extraction of links with `regular expressions`
	* modification of links with `regular expressions`

## Sample commands

```
wget link
wget -i file_with_links.txt
wget -i file_with_links.txt -P ./folderYouWantToSaveTo/ -nc 
```

<!--
1. The first command will simply download a file specified in the link;
2. The second command will go over all links given in the `file_with_links.txt` --- in this file links must be stored one per line;
3. The third command also redirects downloaded results to a subfolder (`-p ./folderYouWantToSaveTo/`, where `-p` is an argument that specifies that `./folderYouWantToSaveTo/` is a folder for saved results; `-nc` is another useful argument, which tells `wget` not to download file if is already exists in the folder --- this command allows you to stop and restart downloading from where you stopped);
-->

Where:

* `-P` is a folder parameter, which instructs `wget` where you want to store downloaded files (*optional*).
* `-nc` is a *no-clobber* parameter, which instructs `wget` to skips files, if they already exist (*optional*)

**NB:** there are many other parameters with which you can adjust `wget` to your needs.

#### OLD STUFF

Doing Digital Humanities practically always means working with structured data of some kind. In most general terms, structured data means some explicit annotation or classification that the machine can understand, and therefore --- effectively use. When we see the word “Vienna”, we are likely to automatically assume that this is the name of the capital of Austria. The machine cannot know that, unless there is something else in the data that allows it to figure it out (here, an XML tag): `<settlement country="Austria" type="capital city">Vienna</settlement>` --- from this *annotation* (and its attributes) the machine can be instructed to interpret the string `Vienna` as a *settlement* of the type *capital city* in the country of *Austria*. It is important to understand most common data formats in order to be able to create and generate them as well as to convert between different formats.

When we decide which format we want to work with, we need to consider the following: the ease of working with a given format (manual editing); suitability for specific analytical software; human-friendliness and readability; open vs. proprietary. In general, it does not make any sense to engage in *the format wars* (i.e., one format is better than another); one should rather develop an understanding that almost every format has its use and value in specific contexts or for specific tasks. What we also want is not to stick to a specific format and try to do everything with it and only it, but rather to be able to write scripts with which we can generate data in suitable formats or convert our data from one format into another.

Let's take a look at a simple example in some most common formats.

### XML (*Extensible Markup Language*)

``` xml
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don’t forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```

### CSV/TSV (*Comma-Separated Values*/ *Tab-Separated Values*)

```
to,from,heading,body
Tove,Jani,Reminder,Don’t forget me this weekend!
```

``` cs
to,from,heading,body
"Tove","Jani","Reminder","Don’t forget me this weekend!"
```

### JSON (*JavaScript Object Notation*)

``` json
{
  "to": "Tove",
  "from": "Jani",
  "heading": "Reminder",
  "body": "Don’t forget me this weekend!"
}
```

### YML or YAML (*Yet Another Markup Language* > *YAML Ain't Markup Language*)

``` yml
to: Tove
from: Jani
heading: Reminder
body: Don’t forget me this weekend
```

### `BibTeX`: *most common bibliographic format*

We have already used this format in our lesson on sustainable writing. If you take a closer look at the record below, you may see that this format contains lots of valuable information. Most of this we will need for our project.

```bibtex
@incollection{LuhmannKommunikation1982,
  title = {Kommunikation mit Zettelkiisten},
  booktitle = {Öffentliche Meinung und sozialer Wandel: Für Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann = Public opinion and social change},
  author = {Luhmann, Niklas},
  editor = {Baier, Horst and Noelle-Neumann, Elisabeth},
  date = {1982},
  pages = {222--228},
  publisher = {{westdt. Verl}},
  location = {{Opladen}},
  annotation = {OCLC: 256417947},
  file = {Absolute/Path/To/PDF/Luhmann 1982 - Kommunikation mit Zettelkiisten.pdf},
  isbn = {978-3-531-11533-7},
  langid = {german}
}
```

## Larger Examples

**NB** data example from [here](https://gist.github.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29).

There are some online converters that can help you to convert one format into another. For example: <http://www.convertcsv.com/>.

### `CSV` / `TSV`

```
city,growth_from_2000_to_2013,latitude,longitude,population,rank,state
New York,4.8%,40.7127837,-74.0059413,8405837,1,New York
Los Angeles,4.8%,34.0522342,-118.2436849,3884307,2,California
Chicago,-6.1%,41.8781136,-87.6297982,2718782,3,Illinois
```

`TSV` is a better option than a `CSV`, since `TAB` characters are very unlikely to appear in values.

Neither `TSV` not `CSV` are good for preserving *new line characters* (`\n`)---or, in other words, text split into multiple lines. As a workaround, one can convert `\n` into some unlikely-to-occur character combination (for example, `;;;`), which would allow to restore `\n` later , if necessary.

### `JSON`

``` json
[
    {
        "city": "New York", 
        "growth_from_2000_to_2013": "4.8%", 
        "latitude": 40.7127837, 
        "longitude": -74.0059413, 
        "population": "8405837", 
        "rank": "1", 
        "state": "New York"
    }, 
    {
        "city": "Los Angeles", 
        "growth_from_2000_to_2013": "4.8%", 
        "latitude": 34.0522342, 
        "longitude": -118.2436849, 
        "population": "3884307", 
        "rank": "2", 
        "state": "California"
    }, 
    {
        "city": "Chicago", 
        "growth_from_2000_to_2013": "-6.1%", 
        "latitude": 41.8781136, 
        "longitude": -87.6297982, 
        "population": "2718782", 
        "rank": "3", 
        "state": "Illinois"
    }
]
```


### `YML`/`YAML`

YAML is often used only for a single set of parameters.

``` yml
city: New York 
growth_from_2000_to_2013: 4.8% 
latitude: 40.7127837 
longitude: -74.0059413
population: 8405837 
rank: 1 
state: New York
```

But it can also be used for storage of serialized data. It has advantages of both JSON and CSV: the overall simplicity of the format (no tricky syntax) is similar to that of CSV/TSV, but it is more readable than CSV/TSV in any text editor, and is more difficult to break—again, due to the simplicity of the format.

``` yml
New York:
  growth_from_2000_to_2013: 4.8% 
  latitude: 40.7127837 
  longitude: -74.0059413 
  population: 8405837 
  rank: 1 
  state: New York 
Los Angeles:
  growth_from_2000_to_2013: 4.8% 
  latitude: 34.0522342 
  longitude: -118.2436849 
  population: 3884307 
  rank: 2 
  state: California
Chicago:
  growth_from_2000_to_2013: -6.1% 
  latitude: 41.8781136 
  longitude: -87.6297982 
  population: 2718782 
  rank: 3 
  state: Illinois
```

YAML files can be read with Python into `dictionaries` like so:

```py
import yaml
dictionary = yaml.load(open(pathToFile))
```

You will most likely need to install `yaml` library; it is also quite easy to write a script that would read such serialized data.

**Note on installing libraries for `python`**. In general, it should be as easy as running the following command in your command line tool:

```
pip install --upgrade libraryName
```

- `pip` is the standard package installer for `python`; if you are running version 3.xx of `python`, it may be `pip3` instead of `pip`. If you have Anaconda installed, you can also use Anacodnda interface to install packages;
- `install` is the command to install a package that you need;
- `--upgrade` is an optional argument that you would need only when you upgrade already installed package;
- `libraryName` is the name of the library that you want to install.

This should work just fine, but sometimes it does not---usually when you have multiple versions of `python` installed and they may start conflicting with each other (another good reason to handle your `python` installations via Anaconda). There is, luckily, a workaround that seems to do the trick.You can modify your command in the following manner:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade libraryName
```

- `python` here is whatever alias you are using for running `python` (e.g., in my case it is `python3`, so the full command will look: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade libraryName`)

## In-Class Practice

Let's try to convert this [`bibTex` file](./files/zotero_biblatex_sample.bib) into other formats. Before we begin, however, let's break down this task into smaller tasks and organize them together in some form of `pseudocode`.

- Which of the above-discussed formats would be most suitable? Why yes, why no?

## Homework{#HWL06}

- Take your bibliography in `bibTeX` format and convert it into: `csv`/`tsv`, `json`, and `yaml`;
  - *Hint*: you should load your data into a `dictionary`;
  - additionally, you might want to create (manually) a dictionary of `bibTeX` field: some of the fields are named differently, while they contain the same type of information --- you want to identify those fields and unify them for your output format, which will improve the quality of your data (the process usually called *normalization*); *hint:* in order to figure out how to identify those fields, you may want to look into the *Word Frequency* program in Chapter 11. You can use this approach to identify all fields and count their frequencies, which will help you to determine which fields to keep and which to normalize (i.e., merge low-frequency fields into high-frequency fields).
- upload your results together with scripts to your homework github repository

**Python**

- Work through Chapters 8 and 11 of Zelle's book; read chapters carefully; work through the chapter summaries and exercises; complete the following programming exercises: 1-8 in Chapter 8 and 1-11 in Chapter 11;
- Watch [Dr. Vierthaler's videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6kqrM2i6BPIpEF5yHPNkYhjHm-FYWh17):
	- Episode 12: Functions
	- Episode 13: Libraries and NLTK
	- Episode 14: Regular Expressions
- **Note:** the sequences are somewhat different in Zelle's textbook and Vierthaler's videos. I would recommend you to always check Vierthaler's videos and also check videos which cover topics that you read about in Zelle's book.

**Webscraping (optional)**

- if you are interested in *webscraping*, you can check the following tutorials:

  - Alternatively, this operation can be done with a Python script: Turkel, William J., and Adam Crymble. 2012. “Downloading Web Pages with Python.” Programming Historian, July. <https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/working-with-web-pages>.

**Submitting homework:**

* Homework assignment must be submitted by the beginning of the next class;
* Now, that you know how to use GitHub, you will be submitting your homework pushing it to github:
  * Create a relevant subfoler in your `HW070172` repository and place your HW files there; push them to your GitHub account;
	* Email me the link to your repository with a short message (Something like: *I have completed homework for Lesson 3, which is uploaded to my repository ... in subfolder `L03`*)
	* In the subject of your email, please, add the following: `CCXXXXX-LXX-HW-YourLastName-YourMatriculationNumber`, where `CCXXXXX` is the numeric code of the course; `LXX` is the lesson for which the homework is being submitted; `YourLastName` is your last name, and `YourMatriculationNumber` is your matriculation number.
	
## Homework Solution{#HWL06S}

Before we proceed, let's make sure that you have the same folder structure on you machine. This will help to ensure that we will not run into other issiues and can focus on solving one problem at a time. (Please, download [these files](./files/L06_Conversion.zip) for `L06_Conversion` folder: unzip and move them all into the folder). The structure should be as follows:

```
.
├── MEMEX_SANDBOX
│   └── data
├── L06_Conversion
│   ├── comments.md
│   ├── pseudocode.md
│   ├── z_1_preliminary.py
│   ├── z_2_conversion_simple.py
│   ├── z_config.yml
│   └── zotero_biblatex_sample.bib
└── L07_Memex_Step1
    ├── ... your scripts ...
    └── ... your scripts ...

```

**NB:** `./MEMEX_SANDBOX/data/` is the target folder for all other assignments to follow. This is where we will be creating our memex.

### Pseudocode solution


0. look at the file, i.e. check the file in order to understand it structure
1. create a holder for our data, which will be `dictionary` (dic, list, etc.)
2. read as one big string
3. split into records using `\n@`
	- we will get a list of strings
4. loop through all the records:
	NB: each records is a string that needs to be converted into something else.
	- we need to split each record using `,\n`
	- now we loop through the list of "key-value" pairs
	- `type{citationkey` element:
		- grab list element with index 0 (`citationkey = record[0]`)
		- split the element on `{`
			- recordType = element[0]
			- citationKey = element[1]
	- add a record into our `dictionary` using citationKey as a key value
	- add recordType into the newly created record
	- process the rest of the record:
		- loop through the record, starting with 1:
			- `for r in record[1:]:`
		- split every element on `=`
			- key = element[0].strip()
			- value = element[1].strip()
			- add our key-value pair into the `dictionary`
5. Save `dictionary` into CSV, JSON, YAML


### Scripts

**Script 1: analyzing bibTex data (`z_1_preliminary.py`)**

```py
import os, yaml

###########################################################
# VARIABLES ###############################################
###########################################################

settingsFile = "z_config.yml"
vars = yaml.load(open(settingsFile))

###########################################################
# FUNCTIONS ###############################################
###########################################################

# analyze bibTeX data; identify what needs to be fixed

def bibAnalyze(bibTexFile):

    tempDic = {}

    with open(bibTexFile, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
        records = f1.read()
        records = records.split("\n@")

        for record in records[1:]:
            # let process ONLY those records that have PDFs
            if ".pdf" in record.lower():
                record = record.strip()
                record = record.split("\n")[:-1]

                for r in record[1:]:
                    r = r.split("=")[0].strip()

                    if r in tempDic:
                        tempDic[r] += 1
                    else:
                        tempDic[r] = 1

    results = []
    for k,v in tempDic.items():
        result = "%010d\t%s" % (v, k)
        results.append(result)

    results = sorted(results, reverse=True)
    results = "\n".join(results)

    with open("bibtex_analysis.txt", "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:
        f9.write(results)

bibAnalyze(vars['bib_all'])

```

This script will create the file `bibtex_analysis.txt`, which will be a frequency list of keys from all `bibTeX` records. We would want to convert this frequency list into a YML file which we can then load with `yaml` library (make sure to install it!). Loading yml data into a python dictionary is as easy as: `dictionary = yaml.load(open(fileNameYml))`.

You can convert the frequency list into a proper yml file using regular expressions:

![](./images/reformatToYML.gif)

**Script 2: loading bibTeX data and converting to other formats (`z_2_conversion_simple.py`)**

```python

import re
import yaml

"""
1. load bibtex file
    - bibliography should be curated in Zotero (one can program cleaning procedures into the script, but this is not as reliable);
    - loading bibtex data, keep only those records that have PDFs;
    - some processing might be necessary (like picking one file out of two and more)
2. convert into other formats
    - csv
    - json
    - yml
"""
