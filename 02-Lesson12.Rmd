# Lesson 12: Topic Modeling *&* TF-IDF (automatic text analysis)

## Thinking about themes and topics

Let's take a look at the following three examples and think about what themes and topics they cover. More importantly, let's think about *how* we "assign" those themes and topics. What is out thinking process? What textual elements do we keep in mind when we argue that such and such text is about such and such topics?

**Example 1**: *Thursday, March 27, 1862* --- LIGHT ARTILLERY

I am authorized by the Governor of Virginia to raise a Company of Light Artillery for the war. All those desirous of enlisting in this the most effective arm of the service, would do well to call at once at the office of Johnson & Guigon, Whig Building.

Uniforms and subsistence furnished.

A. B. GUIGON. mh 25â€”6t

**Example 2**: *Wednesday, August 17, 1864* --- Royal Marriages.

There is a story circulated in Germany, and some in Paris, that the match between the heir-apparent of the Imperial throne of Russia and the Princess Dagmar of Denmark having been definitively broken off, another is in the course of negotiation between His Imperial Highness and the Princess Helens of England.

**Example 3**: *Monday, June 22, 1863* --- NEWS FROM EUROPE.

The steamship Scotia arrived at New York on Thursday from Europe, with foreign news to the 7th inst. The news is not important. The Confederate steamer Lord Clyde was searched by order of the British Government, but nothing contraband being found on board her she was permitted to sail. The Russians have been defeated near Grochoury by the Polish insurgents. The three Powers have sent an earnest note to Russia, asking for a representative Government, a general amnesty, and an immediate cessation of hostilities in Poland.

## Topic Modeling

The formal definition of *topic modeling* is "..." (Source: ...)


## TF-IDF

TF-IDF is the most common automatic method for identifying keywords in texts. This method is the standard approach for identifying keywords. It was first proposed almost fifty years ago, in 1972: @SPARCKJONESStatistical1972. For a humanistic explanation, see chapter 1 in @RamsayReading2011. On this important concept see [this page](https://maximromanov.github.io/univie2020/lesson-10.html).

## Homework{#HWL12}

- Finish the assigned task;
- Annotate your script (i.e., add comment to every line of code describing what is happenning there);

**Submitting homework:**

* Homework assignment must be submitted by the beginning of the next class;
* Now, that you know how to use GitHub, you will be submitting your homework pushing it to github:
  * Create a relevant subfolder in your repository and place your HW files there; push them to your GitHub account;
	* Email me the link to your repository with a short message (Something like: *I have completed homework for Lesson 3, which is uploaded to my repository ... in subfolder `L03`*)
